Setup input guard testing:

	Orientation:
		+ Orientation does not accept a letter outside of H or V
		+ Orientation does not accept a non-letter input value
		+ Orientation does not accept a string of letters including at least one H or V
		+ Orientation does accept capital H or V
		+ Orientation does accept lowercase h or v

	X-coordinate:
		+ X-coordinate does not accept a letter outside of our alphabet
		+ X-coordinate does not accept a non-letter input value
		+ X-coordinate does not accept a string of letters including at least one letter inside our alphabet
		+ X-coordinate does accept capital letters inside our alphabet
		+ X-coordinate does accept lowercase letters inside our alphabet

	Y-coordinate
		+ Y-coordinate does not accept an input value that cannot be converted directly into an integer outside of our range
		+ Y-coordinate does not accept an input value that cannot be converted directly into an integer
		+ Y-coordinate accepts input values that can be converted directly into an integer inside of our range

	Testing at different points in the setup phase still needs to be done 
		- i.e. does it still accept all the right values after four or however many ships are placed?
